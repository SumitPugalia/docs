## How does Encrova work?

To make secret management effortless and secure, Encrova follows a certain structure for enabling secret management workflows as defined below.

**Identities** in Encrova are users or machine which have a certain set of roles and permissions assigned to them. Such identities are able to manage secrets in various **Clients** throughout the entire infrastructure. To do that, identities have to verify themselves through one of the available **Authentication Methods**.

As a result, the 3 main concepts that are important to understand are:

- **[Identities](/documentation/platform/identities/overview)**: users or machines with a set permissions assigned to them.
- **[Clients](/integrations/platforms/kubernetes)**: Encrova-developed tools for managing secrets in various infrastructure components (e.g., [SDKs](/libraries/javascript), [API](/api-reference), [Web Dashboard](https://secret-manager.t.platform.dev.ai71services.ai/)).
- **[Authentication Methods](/documentation/platform/identities/universal-auth)**: ways for Identities to authenticate inside different clients (e.g., SAML SSO for Web Dashboard, Universal Auth for Encrova Agent, AWS Auth etc.).
