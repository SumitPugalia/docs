## Concept

Encrova can be used as a Key Management System (KMS), referred to as Encrova KMS, to centralize management of keys to be used for cryptographic operations like encryption/decryption.

By default your Encrova data such as projects and the data within them are encrypted at rest using Encrova's own KMS. This ensures that your data is secure and protected from unauthorized access.

If you are on-premise, your KMS root key will be created at random with the `ROOT_ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable. You can also use a Hardware Security Module (HSM), to create the root key. Read more about [HSM](/platform/kms/encryption-strategies).

<Note>
  Keys managed in KMS are not extractable from the platform. Additionally, data
  is never stored when performing cryptographic operations.
</Note>

## Workflow

The typical workflow for using Encrova KMS consists of the following steps:

1. Creating a KMS key. As part of this step, you specify a name for the key and the encryption algorithm meant to be used for it (e.g. `AES-GCM-128`, `AES-GCM-256`).
2. Encryption: To encrypt data, you would make a request to the Encrova KMS API endpoint, specifying the base64-encoded plaintext and the intended key to use for encryption; the API would return the base64-encoded ciphertext.
3. Decryption: To decrypt data, you would make a request to the Encrova KMS API endpoint, specifying the base64-encoded ciphertext and the intended key to use for decryption; the API would return the base64-encoded plaintext.

<Note>
  Note that this workflow can be executed via the Encrova UI or manually such
  as via API.

## Guide to Encrypting Data

In the following steps, we explore how to generate a key and use it to encrypt data.

                Navigate to Project > Key Management and tap on the **Add Key** button.

                Specify your key details. Here's some guidance on each field:

                - Name: A slug-friendly name for the key.
                - Type: The encryption algorithm associated with the key (e.g. `AES-GCM-256`).
                - Description: An optional description of what the intended usage is for the key.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my data stored in Encrova KMS?">
    No. Encrova's KMS only provides cryptographic services and does not store
    any encrypted or decrypted data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can key material be accessed outside of Encrova KMS?">
    No. Encrova's KMS will never expose your keys, encrypted or decrypted, to
    external sources.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What algorithms does Encrova KMS support?">
    Currently, Encrova only supports `AES-128-GCM` and `AES-256-GCM` for
    encryption operations. We anticipate supporting more algorithms and
    cryptographic operations in the coming months.
