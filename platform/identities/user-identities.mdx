## Concept

A **user identity** (also known as **user**) represents a developer, admin, or any other human entity interacting with resources in Encrova. 

Users can be added manually (through Web UI) or programmatically (e.g., API) to [organizations](../organization) and [projects](../projects). 

Upon being added to an organization and projects, users assume a certain set of roles and permissions that represents their identity.
