Encrova can be used to create a Private Certificate Authority (CA) hierarchy and issue X.509 certificates for internal use. This allows you to manage your own PKI infrastructure and issue digital certificates for services, applications, and devices.

Encrova's internal PKI offering is split into two modules:

- [Private CA](/platform/pki/private-ca): Encrova lets you create private CAs, including root and intermediary CAs.
- [Certificates](/platform/pki/certificates): Encrova allows you to issue X.509 certificates using the private CAs you create.
