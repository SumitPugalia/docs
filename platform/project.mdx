A project in Encrova belongs to an [organization](./organization) and contains a number of environments, folders, and secrets.
Only users and machine identities who belong to a project can access resources inside of it according to predefined permissions. 

## Project environments

For both visual and organizational structure, Encrova allows splitting up secrets into environments (e.g., development, staging, production). In project settings, such environments can be
customized depending on the intended use case.

## Secrets Overview

The **Secrets Overview** page captures a birds-eye-view of secrets and [folders](./folder) across environments. 
This is useful for comparing secrets, identifying if anything is missing, and making quick changes.
